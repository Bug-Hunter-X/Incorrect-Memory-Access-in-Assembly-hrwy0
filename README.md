This repository contains an example of an uncommon assembly error related to memory access. The error stems from an incorrect addressing mode in the `mov` instruction. The file `bug.asm` demonstrates the flawed code. The solution, `bugSolution.asm`, provides corrected instruction.  The issue lies in the scaling factor applied to the index register, which leads to an incorrect offset calculation, resulting in unintended memory access.
